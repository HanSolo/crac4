## CRaC 4 Demo

### Short description
The demo uses a scheduled task to execute the method ```checkForPrimes()``` every 5 seconds.
In this method a loop will check 100_000 times a random number between 1 - 100_000 for prime.
The ```isPrime(long number)``` method will check if the given number exists in a cache and either
return the result from the cache or calculate the result, put it in the cache and return it.
The cache that is used here, keeps it's items only for a time defined by timeout before they will be
removed from the cache automatically. Everytime a key is requested, it's lifetime in the cache will be
extended by the given timeout value. This leads to the fact that keys that will be requested more often will stay
in the cache where keys that are outdated will be removed from the cache.
The cache also uses a scheduled task that calls the ```clean()``` method once a second and starts after a 
given delay.
The cache timeout and the initial delay can be adjusted using properties file named ```crac4.properties``` which
will be stored in your user home folder.
It contains two entries:
```
initial_cache_clean_delay=50
cache_timeout=10
```
You might need to adjust those values depending on your machine settings (e.g. on my M1 Mac the first run just took 2.5s where on my older Intel Mac it took 22s).
You just have to make sure that the cacheTimeout is not shorter than the time it takes to check the 100_000 numbers for prime, otherwise the cache will be cleaned
too often and you don't see an decrease in calculation time.

### We have two methods that will be called:

The <b>checkForPrimes()</b> method will 100_000 times check a random number between 1 - 100_000 for prime.
After checking all numbers it will print out the time it took to check all numbers on the console and
increase a counter.
```java
private void checkForPrimes() {
    long start = System.nanoTime();
    for (long i = 1 ; i <= 100_000 ; i++) {
        isPrime(RND.nextInt(100_000));
    }
    System.out.println(counter + ". Run: " + ((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1_000_000 + " ms (" + primeCache.size() + " elements cached, " + String.format(Locale.US, "%.1f%%", primeCache.size() / 1_000.0) + ")"));
    counter++;
}
```

The <b>isPrime(final long number)</b> method will be called for each number and either directly returns
the result (in case it's already in the cache) or calculates the result and stores it in the cache.
```java
private boolean isPrime(final long number) {
    if (number < 1) { return false; }
    if (primeCache.containsKey(number)) { return primeCache.get(number).get(); }
    boolean isPrime = true;
    for (long n = number ; n > 0 ; n--) {
        if (n != number && n != 1 && number % n == 0) {
            isPrime = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    primeCache.put(number, isPrime);
    return isPrime;
}
```

### Install and run the code:
You need a Linux x64 machine to run the pre-build OpenJDK version incl. CRaC (e.g. Ubuntu on an Intel machine).

<br>

#### Download [OpenJDK pre-build incl. CRaC](https://github.com/CRaC/openjdk-builds/releases/):
```wget https://github.com/CRaC/openjdk-builds/releases/download/17-crac%2B3/openjdk-17-crac+3_linux-x64.tar.gz```

<br>

#### Extract the tar.gz file with sudo rights:
Make sure you have a folder
```
/usr/lib/jvm
```
otherwise create it by using
```
sudo mkdir /usr/lib/jvm
```
Now extract the tar.gz file
```shell
sudo tar zxvf openjdk-17-crac+3_linux-x64.tar.gz -C /usr/lib/jvm
```

<br>

#### Set JAVA_HOME and add it to PATH:
```
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-17-crac+3_linux-x64
$ export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
$ java -version
openjdk version "17-crac" 2021-09-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17-crac+3-15)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17-crac+3-15, mixed mode, sharing)
```

<br>

#### Clone this repository:
Make sure you have git installed on your machine, otherwise install it by using
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install git
```
Now clone this repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/HanSolo/crac4
```

<br>

#### Build the jar
```
$ cd crac
$ ./gradlew clean build
```

<br>

#### Run the example
Make sure you have the folder ```crac-files``` in your home folder, otherwise create it with
```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir crac-files
```

Open a shell (SHELL 1)
```
cd /build/libs
java -XX:CRaCCheckpointTo=/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/crac-files -jar ./crac4-17.0.0.jar
```
Now you should see something as follows on your screen:
```
Running on CRaC (PID 20719)

2. Run 10290 ms (86556 elements in cache)

4. Run 1378 ms (98244 elements in cache)
5. Run 527 ms (99336 elements in cache)

12. Run 14 ms (99999 elements in cache)
13. Run 18 ms (100000 elements in cache)
```

Open another shell (SHELL 2) and execute the following command to create the checkpoint
```
$ cd /CRAC_PROJECT_FOLDER/build/libs
$ jcmd crac4-17.0.0.jar JDK.checkpoint
20719:
Command executed successfully
```

SHELL 1 should now show something as follows:
```

In the first shell (SHELL 1) window where you started the jar file, restore the checkpoint by calling
```

If everything worked as expected you should now see the program continue to run

App stopped in shutdown hook
```
Now you can stop the running app by pressing CTRL+C

As you can see the counter continued counting with 14 and did not restart from 1.
And because the cache was also stored when we created the checkpoint, it will directly
be filled after we restore the app from the checkpoint. And with the cache filled, the
call to ```checkForPrimes()``` will return quickly.
You can imagine that this approach drastically reduces the startup times of applications.
